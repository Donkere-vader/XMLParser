# XMLParser
A XMLParser written by me.
It's probably not so good/ clean good. And probably not the best way to do it. But this is my first parser. So don't go to hard on me :)).

## Reliabillity
This is a very simple module and not tested that much, I'm going to use this in my own project but There is a big chance that there are some reliabillity issues with different forms of formatting and such.

Please repport any issues you encounter.
